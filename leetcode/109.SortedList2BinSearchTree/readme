Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.


Example:

Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5

Key Points:
1. 要求生成的树为平衡树, 即对任意节点node, abs(maxDepth(node->left) - maxDepth(node->right)) < 1
2. 树为搜索树，即对任意节点node, node->left->val < node->val < node->right->val

注意答案并不唯一，那么
1. 可以假设任意node的左子树节点数与右子树节点数相关不大于1，所以可以直接对vector分片
